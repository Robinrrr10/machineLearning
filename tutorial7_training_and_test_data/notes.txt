Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 7: Training and Testing Data
----------------------------------------------------------------
When we have data for training, it is better to use 80% of the data for training
And remaining 20% of the data we can use for testing for testing

We can use train test split to split the data

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)     //Here it will split 20% for training data and other 60% is for taining, This will return four params like above

Now can use LinearRegression for training

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
reg.predict(X_test)    //This will show the value. Wont be exactly same. But will be near to the expected value
Now we can compare the predicted value with y_test to see how near it was
We can use score method to check the accuracy score
Using score method we can find the accuracy

Tutorial 1 : Machine Learning Tutorial Python : What is Machine Learning?
--------------------------

We need to think from how the baby learn.
We are showing a cow to the baby and we say this is cow.
Then we are showing few more cows to the baby and we saw this is a cow
We will continue this.
Next time when baby see any cow, then can say it is cow.
Say to other things or products.

So here we are training the baby with different inputs of the same products multiple times for learning.
Then it learn and able to recognise.
Same will be doing in machine learning.
This process is deep learning. Deep learning is also a part of machine learning

We will using some mathametical concepts for achiving many things in machine learning.

Below are few examples of machines learning which are already there
1. Google gmail spam folder. Google automatically identify the spam folder and keep it in spam folder instead of inbox. Because it knows about spam folder which was alredy there is their system for long
2. Youtube recommendation videos
3. Even driverless cars or self driving cars

Tutorial 2: Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 2: Linear Regression Single Variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the tutorial where we can learn how to predict the values when we have list of two pair values.
Here we have used the example of area in square feets and its price in a city
When we have few in the list, we can able to predict the value for any square fleet.

When one value is depend on one variable, below is the formula
y = mx + b
Here we give many sample input with list of two values. Based on this formula, it will predict for the given one


x is the coefficient(independent variable or feature)
b is the intercept
y is the is the dependent variable (which is target value)


-------------------------


Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 3: Linear Regression Multiple Variables
---------------------------
Here for finding one value, it might be depend on multiple values.
Eg: calculating home price is depend on squarefeet, number of bedrooms, age of home etc
So when one taget value depend on multiple variable, we can go with below formula

y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + b

Below is the formula for above example

price = m1 * area + m2 * bedrooms + m3 * age + b

Here area, bedrooms and age are independent variables
m1, m2 and m3 are coefficient
b is intercept
price is dependent variables

Independent variables are also called as features

We can have n number of independent variables and coefficient combinations



math.floor(giveValue)    # this will give the roundedv value

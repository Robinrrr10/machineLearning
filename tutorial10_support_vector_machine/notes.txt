Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 10 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Support vector machine is one of the technique to solve classification problem in the better way.
It will consider near by splitting plots/points
We need to dray the maximum line helps to split. that will be good to split the line and that works effectively
In 2D we need to draw a line. In 3D we need to split with the plane and for n number of D we cannot imagine. but theoritically and mathematically it was possible to split

We need to understand below 2 
1. Gamma 
2. Regularization

Gamma:
High Gamma: Here we can draw the splitting line near the splitting plots. It may not be straight. Here we will consider only near by splitting plots
Low Gamma: Here will consider near by and far points both. Here we will draw a straight line which splits. 

Both the approaches are fine. But low gamma would be better in many cases. Rarely we will get the failure. But commutaion and overall it would be fine
We might get some error in Low gamma. But stil it was fine and better


Regularization:
High Regularization: Here we will carefully draw the line which splits both
Low Regularization: Here will split with straight line which will fit for splitting

Low regularization might have some error. But still it was better



We might have complex data frame with x y and z
We can apply formula
z = x^2 + y ^2 
(x square + y square)

We can have X and Z in regular and Y will be straight line again.
Once plotted we should be able to get the line


See jupyter notebook for more details

For using SVM use below

from sklearn.svm import svc
model = SVC()
model.fit(X, y)

We can pass the parameter in SVC(), By that we can fine tune the model for more accuracy.

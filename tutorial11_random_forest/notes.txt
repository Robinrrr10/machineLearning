Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 11 Random Forest
---------------------------------------------------
Here the dataset will be splitted into multiple random slots.
Decision tree will be created for each slots to take the decision.
Based on majority of the decision, prediction will be happen here.
Prediction will be applied based on majority of the decision

Here we will use below to use this:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

We can fine tune with multiple paramters.
Main parameter to fine tune is n_estimators count. Here we can give how many decision tree we need to split up. 
By default, it will be 10. We can increase and fine tune. and we can see which one gives high score


y_prediction = model.predict(X_test)

Once done, we can use confusion metrics to see the accuracy

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_predicted)

We can visualized the confusion matrix on the seaborn for better visualization.

For more details please go throught the jupyter notebook for this tutorial

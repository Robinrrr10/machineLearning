Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 9 Decision Tree
----------------------------------------------------
Some time we cannot draw the line base on linear or logical regression.
In that case, we need to go with decision tree algorithim
In this logic it will make the decision based on each value.
And make the decision like a tree

Here first on what basics the order should start.
Based on the order, the performance will be get impacted
First it will check on one of the column and check the entropy, whether the values are same for one of the column or not.
If same, it is low entropy (Low different and mostly same) and this is high information gain and try to start with this as the root tree
Here it will start with the company where for facebook all target values are same

When dealing with decision tree, we will hear about gini impurity which means it is the impurity in the data set

We can use 

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le_company = LabelEncoder()

df['company_n'] = df.fit_transform(df['company'])
Like wise we need assign numeric values for each values in different columns
Then drop the string columns as we will be using the numeric columns

We can make ready the input and target file

For decision tree, we can use below
from sklearn import tree
model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)    //Pass the input X and target y here
model.score(X, y)
model.predict([[5, 2, 2]])

Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 18: K nearest neighbors classification with python code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a classification technique which predict based number of nearest values
Here K is the number of nearest value.

Lets say we are taking iris data set and based on length and width of the flower the type might vary
If we plot all in the chat, we can see how it looks like.
Then we should be able to predict if some new point was given

Please refer images for more details

Here we will be giving the K which is number of nearest value.
We will find the nearest values and based on that we will see which type of flower is near to that. 
Based on k number, the highest number is the actual value.
Here we should also consider giving the correct value of K. There are changes only very values data points are available for that type itself.
So in that case, if the K is higher it might predict the wrong value.
So the K value should not be very less and should not be very high

Below is the documentation for KNN classifier (KNeighborsClassifier)
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html

Use below to use KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)   //Here we will give the k // number of k nearest value
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
model.score(X_test, y_test)


We can also see confusion metrics for the same
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_metrix
y_predicted = model.predict(X_test)
cm = confusion_metrix(y_test, y_predicted)
cm


We can visualize nicely using seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seabord as sn
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))
sn.heatmap(cm, annot=True)
plt.xlabel('predicted')
plt.ylabel('truth')


We can also visualize using classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_predicted))
This will give some details about the report

Please check the notebook of this tutorial for more details

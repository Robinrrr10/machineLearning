Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 3: Linear Regression Multiple Variables
---------------------------
Here for finding one value, it might be depend on multiple values.
Eg: calculating home price is depend on squarefeet, number of bedrooms, age of home etc
So when one taget value depend on multiple variable, we can go with below formula

y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + b

Below is the formula for above example

price = m1 * area + m2 * bedrooms + m3 * age + b

Here area, bedrooms and age are independent variables
m1, m2 and m3 are coefficient
b is intercept
price is dependent variables

Independent variables are also called as features

We can have n number of independent variables and coefficient combinations

Below is to find the mean value 
df.ColumnName.mean()
or
df['columnName'].mean()    

Eg:
df['test_score(out of 10)'].mean()



math.floor(giveValue)    # this will give the roundedv value

Eg:
import math
mean_value = math.floor(df['test_score(out of 10)'].mean())

Below is to replace the null value with specific vaue (Mostly with 0 or mean value)
df.columnName = df.columnName.fillna(mean_value)
or
df['columnName'] = df['columnName'].fillna(mean_value)

Eg"
df['score'] = df['score'].fillname(0)    # to fill the empty value with 0
or
df['score'] = df['score'].fillname(mean_value)    # to fill the empty value with mean value

reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()
ref.fit(df[[area, bedroom, age]], price)    //Here we are adding the input to train,

ref.coef_        #To give coefficient
ref.intercept_   # To give intercept value

ref.predict([[4000, 3, 5]])   - This will print the predicted value as per input given. We should give same number of parameters and its values

Now it will predict the value and give the results.

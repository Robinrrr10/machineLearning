Tutorial 5: Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 5: Save Model Using Joblib And Pickle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this tutorial we can see how we can save the model and we can load the model
There are two ways to save and load the model
1. pickle
2. sklearn joblib or joblib

We can save the trained model


1.pickle: 
//Below are the steps to save the model

import pickle
with open('new_file_name', 'wb') as f:                 //wb means write byte
    pickle.dump(givenModel, f)

Eg:

with open('my_model', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(reg, f)



//Below are the steps to load the saved model

import pickle
with open('file_name', 'rb') as f:                 //rb means read byte
    giveobjName = pickle.load(f)

Eg:
import pickle
with open('my_model', 'rb') as f:  
    ref = pickle.load(f)




2.  sklearn joblib or joblib   //joblib is the latest

//Below are the steps to save the model

from sklearn.external import joblib

joblib.dump(giveModelHere, 'giveFileNameHere')                     # This is to save the model
Eg:
joblib.dump(reg, 'myModel')


//Below are the steps to load the model

from sklearn.external import joblib  //Old
from joblib       //newone

modelObj = joblib.load(giveFileNameHere)                     # This is to load the model
Eg:
model = joblib.load('myModel')


Model will be saved in binary format.
When our model has large numpy array it is suggested to use joblib.
In other cases we can use pickle.
But mosly both works in same way
